### About me

I graduated from Fashion Design but I hated my sewing machine so I turned to my computer for a nicer relationship.
I've worked in Communication, Digital Marketing, Social Media and Content Creation before fully embracing my true self and enroling in the pirate ship that is the Ironhack WebDev Bootcamp.
